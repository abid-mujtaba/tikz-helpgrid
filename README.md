# tikz-helpgrid

This is basically a repackaging (and slight tweaking) of an off-the cuff solution given by SÃ©bastien Gross
on his github page at: https://github.com/renard/tikz-dimline inside the file tikz-dimline-doc.tex

I have simply placed it in a separate .sty file and made it in to a package for ease of use.
